# arb_hash
Arbitrary block length hash function, potentially cryptographically secure. Passes BigCrush

This crate contains a number of useful functions for working with several applications of arb_hash,
along with additional helper functions for managing the blocks used in said functions.

The crate has been designed to run many functions at compile time, if possible.
